### Summary
At CARPOOL's Northgate Location, they currently use paper and Google Sheets to sign riders up, assign cars, and route drivers. They need a web application that is mobile friendly for their staff to use that includes a passenger sign up form, a a map visual that plots input passenger destinations and checks the location is within city limits for car insurance purposes. Our system will simplify the sign up process for customers and staff members, and help group passengers in similar destination areas together based on CARPOOL's current quadrant based system. In addition, we will be able to digitize some paper forms they are using like passenger/ ride notes to help with management.

The navigation system has strict city limits restrictions and we also need to preserve rider confidentiality with a secure backend storage for forms. The stakeholders are CARPOOL staff -> drivers, coordinators, and executives, and CARPOOL passengers at the Northgate location.
