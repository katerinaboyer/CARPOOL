# CARPOOL  
Our application can be found at http://thawing-atoll-80530.herokuapp.com  

Rider Application: Used generate  scaffold to make a basic layout of what we will be using. I found out about it at this link https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html. You can look at it by running 'rails server' and then going to the url localhost:3000/rider_applications.   
  
  For development team:  
  >>git pull origin master  
  navigate to the rails application in your terminal  
  >> bundle update  
  >> bundle install  
  >> rails db:migrate  
  >> rails s  
  navigate to localhost:3000/rider_applications
